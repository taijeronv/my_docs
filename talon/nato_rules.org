* Introduction 
MLCC is a simulation on a brigade/division level of a possible attempt by
opposing forces to liberate Western Europe from the blue forces alliance. 

* General Course of Play
  NATO is a two-player game.  Each player moves his units and executes attacks
  on enemy units in turn, attempting to fulfill the conditions of victory.  To
  move from one hex to another, each unit expends a portion of its movement
  allowance.  Combat is resolved by comparing the total combat strength of
  adjacent opposing units and expressing the comparison as a simplified
  probability ratio (odds).  A dies is rolled and the outcome indicated on the
  combat results table is applies to the units involved.
