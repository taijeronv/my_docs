** Introduction
   Talon is a simulation of small-unit operations at the platoon level.
   Players assume the role of a platoon leader and maneuver fire-teams to accomplish specific goals.

** Dice and Measurement
   Talon uses random numbers between 1-6 which represent a six-sided
   die.  Distance is measured in pixels with each pixel equal too {xx}
   meters.
** Units
   Talon units are fire-teams which represent 4-6 men, and weapons
   teams which represent two to three men.  Some "units" maybe be
   represented by individuals such as leaders, medics, EOD, dog
   handler, etc.

   - Every game should have at least one leader.
   - Each unit is defined by their level of training, experience, and
     it's weapons/armor.
   - Unit Cohesion: Units must remain within {xx} meters of each other
     or incur an activation penalty of -1 per wayward figure.

   Unit Training and Expertise
   | Level    | Activation | Expertise | Suppress | Cmd Pts |
   |----------+------------+-----------+----------+---------|
   | Green    |          5 |         6 |        1 |       1 |
   | Seasoned |          4 |         5 |        2 |       2 |
   | Veteran  |          3 |         4 |        3 |       2 |


** Initiative
   - All units begin the game in the "On Guard" state.
   - At the beginning of each turn each player rolls 1d6 + any scenario
     modifiers.  Reroll any ties.
     + The player that scores the highest can attempt to activate one
       unit first. - See Activation section below.
     + He continues to acticate units until he fails actication.  Then
       the initiative passes to his opponent with the next highest
       score and so on.
   - The initiative passes back and forth as players pass and fail
     activation rolls.  The turn ends when all have attempted to
     activated each unit in their command.

** Activation and Actions
   - To activate a unit, a player must equal or beat the unit leader's
     activation score on a roll of 1d6.
   - Activation roll has the following modifiers:

     | +1: unit has no enemies in line of sight. |
     |-------------------------------------------|
     | -1: Per suppressed figure.                |

     - A unit that successfully activates can perform two action in any
       order, or may do nothing at all.

       | Number of Actions | Effect                                                                          |
       |-------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
       | 1: Move           | Move {xx} meters                                                                |
       | 1: Assault        | Move {xx} meters and assault                                                    |
       | 1: Go on guard    | React ONCE per turn to return fire, shoot moving enemies, or counter-charge     |
       | 1: Shoot          | Shoot with ranged weapons                                                       |
       | 1: Retreat        | With draw up too {xx} meters away from the enemy.                               |
       | 2: Sneak          | Move {xx} meters and gain soft cover                                            |
       | 2: Hide           | Drop to the nearest cover within move action.  Treat cover as one level higher. |

   - A unit failing activation immediately rolls again - a pass enables the unit to go On Guard of charge.

   - The "On Guard" state ends when the unit next fires or tries to activate.
     "Hide" and "Sneak" end when the unit moves or fights in Assault.

   - No unit may activate more than once per turn unless given a "push" order from a commander.
