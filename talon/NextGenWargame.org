** Rules
*** Introduction
- Talon is a simulation of small-unit operations at the platoon level.
- Players assume the role of a platoon leader and maneuver fire-teams to
  accomplish specific goals.

*** Dice and Measurement
Talon uses random numbers between 1-6 which represent a six-sided
die.  Distance is measured in pixels with each pixel equal too {xx}
meters.

*** Units
Talon units are fire-teams which represent 4-6 men, and weapons
teams which represent two to three men.  Some "units" maybe be
represented by individuals such as leaders, medics, EOD, dog
handler, etc.

- Every game should have at least one leader.
- Each unit is defined by their level of training, experience, and it's
 weapons/armor.
- Unit Cohesion: Units must remain within {xx} meters of each other or
 incur an activation penalty of -1 per wayward figure.

Unit Training and Expertise
| Level    | Activation | Expertise | Suppress | Cmd Pts |
|----------+------------+-----------+----------+---------|
| Green    |          5 |         6 |        1 |       1 |
| Seasoned |          4 |         5 |        2 |       2 |
| Veteran  |          3 |         4 |        3 |       2 |


*** Initiative
- All units begin the game in the "On Guard" state.
- At the beginning of each turn each player rolls 1d6 + any scenario
  modifiers.  Reroll any ties.
  + The player that scores the highest can attempt to activate one
    unit first. - See Activation section below.
  + He continues to acticate units until he fails actication.  Then
    the initiative passes to his opponent with the next highest
    score and so on.
- The initiative passes back and forth as players pass and fail
  activation rolls.  The turn ends when all have attempted to
  activated each unit in their command.


*** Activation and Actions
- To activate a unit, a player must equal or beat the unit leader's
  activation score on a roll of 1d6.
- Activation roll has the following modifiers:

  | +1: unit has no enemies in line of sight. |
  |-------------------------------------------|
  | -1: Per suppressed figure.                |

  - A unit that successfully activates can perform two action in any
    order, or may do nothing at all.

    | Number of Actions | Effect                                                                          |
    |-------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | 1: Move           | Move {xx} meters                                                                |
    | 1: Assault        | Move {xx} meters and assault                                                    |
    | 1: Go on guard    | React ONCE per turn to return fire, shoot moving enemies, or counter-charge     |
    | 1: Shoot          | Shoot with ranged weapons                                                       |
    | 1: Retreat        | With draw up too {xx} meters away from the enemy.                               |
    | 2: Sneak          | Move {xx} meters and gain soft cover                                            |
    | 2: Hide           | Drop to the nearest cover within move action.  Treat cover as one level higher. |

- A unit failing activation immediately rolls again - a pass enables the unit to go On Guard of charge.

- The "On Guard" state ends when the unit next fires or tries to activate.
  "Hide" and "Sneak" end when the unit moves or fights in Assault.

- No unit may activate more than once per turn unless given a "push" order
  from a commander.


*** Leaders and Characters
Characters and commanders are represented as individual icons.
Each commander has a level and command points as shown on the troop level
table.


*** Line of Sight (LOS)
- If half the target unit in LOS or cover, the whole unit is in LOS of cover.
- Suppressed figures may not fire.
- A unit may fire at enemy units to which it has LOS.
- A unit may only target enemy units with the same are of cover if they are
  within 6 inches.
- A defined are of cover will block line of sight.
- Units may fire into or out of cover if they or their targets are within
  {xx} meters of the covers edge.


*** Cover and Terrain
Cover and terrain effects cause the most arguments in wargaming. We direct
your attention back to the Cardinal Rules, and urge you to settle disputes
with a die roll and discuss the particulars after the game.  A unit benefits
from cover if at least half its models are in or behind it. If the target of
a firing attack is in cover modify the firer’s expertise as follows:

| Cover    | Mod | Examples                                           |
|----------+-----+----------------------------------------------------|
| Soft     |  +1 | Undergrowth, woods, wooden buildings, hedgerows    |
| Moderate |  +2 | Stone, brick walls, buildings, rubble, trenches    |
| Hard     |  +3 | Bunkers                                            |
| Linear   | N/A | Walls, trenches, other things usually blocking LOS |

Total up all cover modifiers (even if this modifies the firer’s expertise above
6+) before adding any positive modifiers such as Aim bonuses.

- Infantry moves through cover at normal speed.
- Models lose d6” of movement for each action wholly or partially spent in
  difficult terrain such as swamp,fast-moving and/or deep watercourse, dense
  rubble, climbing large obstacles, and the like.
- Infantry models lose 1” of movement per 1” height when crossing a linear
  obstacle.


*** Shooting
Each figure in the firing Unit throws one die per Fire Point, (FP). Each die
that equals or exceeds their Expertise rating is a Hit.

- The target player allocates hits amongst models in the
  unit as evenly as possible.
- If a hit model is wearing armor, it throws 1D6 per hit, trying to equal or
  exceed its armor’s Save value to disregard the hit. Passengers inside a vehicle
  need not roll if the vehicle makes its saves.

| Type       | Save | Examples                  |
|------------+------+---------------------------|
| Light      |   6+ | Flak jacket, police armor |
| Medium     |   5+ | SWAT                      |
| Heavy      |   4+ | SciFi                     |
| Power      |   3+ | Power armor               |
| Battlesuit |   2+ | Tactical Dreadnought      |

Unsaved hits against a Unit must be taken as casualties, suppressed figures, or
a combination of both to the allowable limits set by the Unit’s
training\expertise level’s “Supp” score.

- A figure cannot be made both suppressed and a casualty from the same bout of
  received fire.
- However, if there are more unsaved hits than there are figures in the unit,
  the unit is wiped out.
- A unit returning fire while On Guard does so AFTER resolving hits from being
  shot at.
- A unit may only shoot once per activation.


*** Assault
A Unit must use a Charge action to move into close combat with an enemy Unit.

- The attacked unit tests morale (use the Activation score). So do the attackers
  if they take casualties while charging. Failure means immediate d6” retreat.
- The attacking Unit moves its figures into base contact with enemy figures, or
  as far as they can move. Then the opponent can move up any unengaged figures
  that are within 3” of an assaulting enemy figure.
- Both sides simultaneously roll one die per figure & use their Expertise rating
  to determine hits.
- Figures that are already suppressed before this attack strike after all other
  attacks are resolved.
- All hits not saved by personal armor result in casualties. Cover has no effect.
- Units may only take casualties, not suppression.
- The combat continues at the beginning of each subsequent turn. The units
  involved automatically activate for the turn at that point.
- To attempt to withdraw from combat a Unit must make a successful Activation
  roll & then move 1d6” away from their opponents. If the opponents also make a
  successful Activation roll they can follow up 1d6”. If they catch their enemies
  combat continues.
- Close Assault supersedes the normal Activation rules.
