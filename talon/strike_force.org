2. A hexagonal (flat side up) grid is superimposed upon the mapsheet to control
   movement, combat between units, and detection.
3. Each hex represents 5 kilometers.
4. Maximum map size cannot exceed 20 hexes for width or height, any combination with those limits is allowed.

3. The hex grid is based on the size of the map image.  The hex height is 64 px.
4. Refer to the Flashpoint Campaigns manual on creating a map.

** Map Editing
1. Load the map image.
2. Create a hex grid based on the image size.
3. Hexes are 64 px high.

* Sequence of Play

- Sequence
  1. The player with the initiative moves.
  2. The player with the initiative attacks.
  3. The second player moves.
  4. The second player attacks.

* Movement
** Movement Rules
1. Every unit has a fixed number of movement points also called a movement
   allowance.
2. Units must pay a movement point cost when entering certain types of terrain.
3. When a unit enters a hex the cost of the terrain type is deducted from the
   available movement points.
4. If a unit attempts to enter a hex for which it does not have enough points to
   pay for entry it cannot do so.
5. Units cannot exceed their movement allowance.  For example if the cost to
   enter wooded terrain is 3 and the unit only has 2 MPs left then it cannot
   enter that hex.
6. Movement points are replenished at the beginning of a new turn.

** How to Move a Unit
1. The player right-clicks on a unit and selects the move order.
2. The player creates a route by left-clicking on individual hexes.
3. The player may continue to plot a route as long as the unit has enough
   movement points to enter a hex.
4. To assign the movement order the player left-clicks on the unit.  At this
   point the unit has the plotted route.
5. A player may cancel a route by right-clicking on the unit and selecting cancel order.
6. If the player wishes to change the route the player simple re-enters a new
   route using steps one through four.
