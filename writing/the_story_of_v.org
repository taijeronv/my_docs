  How does it feel to be this person, or these people, having sex? How do these
  sex acts feel physically -- soft, tight, sharp, gentle, smooth, cold? 
  How do they feel emotionally â€“ nervous, urgent, giddy, relieved, beloved, dirty?

  It has to convey what the sex means.  Why the people are having it. Whether
  it's giving them what they'd hoped for. What about it is surprising. Whether
  anything is going to be different now because of this sex.

    is so sexy. See Delta of Venus "Pierre"

- Story V sucks dick on the side of the highway on the way to Vegas.

- Characters V - her usual horny self. Rick - Her current love interest.
  
- Plot
  - V and her lover have a conversation about sex. V and her lover are still in
    the honeymoon phase which means lots of fucking. V's lover asks where V has
    sucked dick in the past. V tells him in all sorts of places theater, parking
    lot, beach, car. V starts to rub her lovers cock, he has a hard time
    concentrating on driving. V's pussy is throbbing, she is thinking of sucking
    his cock while he drives. They are on the highway going to Vegas about 10
    miles outside of Barstow in the middle of nowhere.
  
  - V's proposes a roadside blowjob. V has a flashback to the year before
    sucking dick in a car. She tells her lover the story but doesn't say who it
    is. It's her previous lover who is also friends with her current lover. She
    thinks about how much better a fuck her former lover is. She asks him to
    pull over and begins to suck his dick.
  
  - V's sucks her lovers cock. She loves a hard cock in her mouth. She's been
    sucking dick since she was 16. She's never had a bad experience sucking
    dick. She loves how it makes her lover feel. She does it out of love.
 
I'm never surprised when I get the question, for some reason it always
comes up. How many men have you slept with? Have you ever been with a woman?
How do I compare to the others? By the way how many others have there been?
It's always the same question. In some ways it amuses me, they ask the
question then when you answer it they feel jealous or hurt. The best way to
answer such questions is with brutal honesty. Am I the best? Sorry, I've had
better. What better way to put them in their place. Oh and my favorite, what's
the biggest you've ever been with? As if I carry around a measuring tape for
such occasions.

To be honest you don't need a measuring tape, a woman knows a big one as soon
as its owner tries to ram it home. Why do men that are huge think they are
good lovers? I will admit one of the most exciting sights is when a "big" man
reveals his treasure. Feeling the weight of it in your hands, knowing that it
would take three or four average sized men to equal this one. Men with size
know they have to make sure the woman is ready, if not they run the risk of
scaring her off. There's nothing worse than a big cock trying to push into a
pussy that's not quite ready. I get extremely wet whenever a man strokes
himself in front of me. I ask them "Baby can you please get it wet and stroke
it for me." It doesn't take much to get a man to stroke
himself, especially in front of a woman who he intends to take. I instruct
them "Stroke it til you're about to cum, then I know you're ready." Sometimes
I will bend down and blow on him while he strokes it, or lay back with my legs
wide open so he can see his goal.

Rick is my fiance.  We were introduced by my previous lover who was 20 years
older than me.  Jim was a fantastic lover but I will save that for another story.
