  How does it feel to be this person, or these people, having sex? How do these
  sex acts feel physically -- soft, tight, sharp, gentle, smooth, cold? 
  How do they feel emotionally â€“ nervous, urgent, giddy, relieved, beloved, dirty?

  It has to convey what the sex means.  Why the people are having it. Whether
  it's giving them what they'd hoped for. What about it is surprising. Whether
  anything is going to be different now because of this sex.

  - Scene 1 The conversation
    Why do men always want to know about my previous sex-life? Isn't it enough
    that I'm fucking them.  Why do they insist on knowing my history?
    
    Rick is my fiance. Somewhat of a conservative his performance in the bedroom
    is a bit lacking. He's not a bad lover, he's just not exciting. You know
    what I'm talking about, he goes through the motions, makes me cum, but
    afterwards it's nothing to remember.
 
    The topic for the moment was cock sucking. Apparently he wants to know where
    and how many cocks have been in my mouth. I wish he would be happy with the
    fact that I suck him dry whenever he wants it but I guess his curiosity has
    got the better of him. Even if I wanted too I couldn't tell him how many,
    needless to say it's a lot and my memory isn't that good. I've had dicks in
    my mouth since I was 16, what I can I say I love sucking cock.

    "Look how many dicks, that's off the table" I smiled "But if you want to know
    where that's Ok."

    "Locker room, theater, beach, car, parks, university, dorm room, to name a few."

    I'm not sure about the look on his face but he seemed a bit surprised.

    "Baby, are you shocked?" I asked.

    I could tell that he was, but I could also see he was a bit turned on.  His
    cock shown through his jeans which clearly meant something.

    "Yeah just a little bit but it's Ok, I suppose all that practice is why I
    can cum in your mouth in no time."

    I have to admit the conversation had an affect on my.  I love sucking Rick's
    dick, it's not huge which means it's fairly easy to suck.  Jim's cock was
    above average and always caused my jaw to ache after 30 minutes of sucking.
    At the moment was wet with excitement and wanted to do something about it.

    We were about 10 miles outside of Barstow on the way to Vegas.  Rick was
    busy with the driving, I guess I will have to wait til we get to our hotel
    to take care of myself.  In the meantime I thought I would give him a treat.  

    I leaned back against the door of the truck and opened my legs.  I reached
    underneath my shorts and felt my wet panties.  I rubbed my clit and closed
    my eyes.  I could feel my pussy responding with a little contraction.  

    "Oh baby, my pussy is so hot for you right now."

    "Would you mind if I sucked you dry?"
  
  - Scene 2 V sucks Rick's cock
    I opened my eyes to catch his reaction.  Somehow he managed to free his cock
    and was stroking it while driving.  He was hard as a rock and the head of
    his cock was a reddish-purple color.  I knew he was close.

    "Pull over."

    He pulled over on the highway and let the truck idle.  He adjusted his seat
    and leaned back giving me some room to work.

    I took the head of his cock between my lips.  I could taste his pre-cum.

    "Fuck baby, you're an exceptional cocksucker."

    I took the length of his cock in my mouth and held it there.  I swirled my
    tongue around the shaft and head and could feel him begin to thrust his
    hips.  I slowly raised my head while keeping pressure on the shaft.  I was a
    slow luxurious blowjob but I knew he would cum in no time.

    "Oh baby, you taste so good.  I want you to explode in my mouth, but first
    you gotta promise me something." 

    "Yeah sure, whatever you want." He said.

    "When we get to the hotel I want you to fuck me for an hour straight."

    I knew he couldn't last more than 10 minutes of straight fucking, I was
    playing with him.

    "Yes baby I would be glad to fuck you for as long as you like."

    I smiled and continued sucking his cock.  I cupped his balls in my hand
    while my head moved faster.  He places his hand on my head and pushed my
    head down.  Some women don't like this but I think it's a turn on.

    More pre-cum and he started to explode.  I sucked his cock dry swallowing
    every drop.  Normally it only takes about five minutes to make him cum this
    way.  Today it was around three.
  
  - Scene 2
    V thought to herself "I've been here before haven't I."

    One year ago I was on the same trip with a different man.  The conversation
    started the same way and ended with his cock in my mouth.

    Jim was a much better fuck than Rick, hell he'd written a book about the subject
    so he better be good.  He was much more livelier even though he was in his 60's,
    yep that's right a 20 year difference.  It was Jim who really taught me to suck
    dick.  Well, let me clarify I've always been good, but Jim helped me think about
    why I was good. 

    Ladies, never suck a soft dick, take your time and get it hard.  

    In this situation Rick's cock was already hard as glass.

    I thought to myself I better make this quick, we don't want to get caught.  In
    my experience the quickest way to make a man cum fast, aside from sticking a
    finger in his ass, is to suck him like a cock starved whore.  So what does that
    mean? Suck him fast, wet, and with lots of head movement.

    I started by trying to choke myself on his cock while producing good amount of
    slobber. There's a way  to take a cock in your mouth that makes it feel like a
    pussy.  The trick is to create a feeling of lightness while maintaining enough
    contact to feel like the walls of your pussy.

    I could tell he was close, his cock was leaking a ton of precum but he hadn't
    yet pulled the trigger.

    All men have there "tells" so pay attention ladies, this is the art of fucking
    that is most ignored.  Reading your partner.  The better the read the better the
    experience.  You need to know his triggers.  What does he do or say right before
    he comes? How about leading up to his orgasm?

    In Rick's case he would put his hands on the back of my head at the same time
    thrusting his cock as if he was fucking my ass or pussy.  Jim liked it when I
    fingered his ass, oh it's not so bad just make sure you use lube, spit is not 
    lube at least not for someones ass.

    "Baby, do you know why I'm so good at sucking your dick?"

    I didn't wait for him to answer.

    "Because I'm doing it with love." I took his whole cock in my mouth and held it.
    I swirled my tongue around the shaft and head.

    He exploded in my mouth.  My God this has always been a turn of for me.  The
    moment a man cums in my mouth.

- Plot

- Scenes
 I couldn't help myself ever since the first time we fucked I couldn't get him 
 out of my mind.  Ok, so I'm recently divorced at this point any cock would do,
 but with him it was more.  

 "Hey baby" I called out as I entered the room. My God I'm dripping wet and he
 hasn't even touched me yet.  "V what are you doing here this is a nice
 surprise?" 
  
 I smiled knowing that if I said what was really on my mind his cock would be 
 in me in a flash.  "My mom is watching the kids so I thought I'd spend the
 night, is that ok?"
 
 I'd met Jim just two days ago, a gift from some friends if you really must
  know.  Although my divorce was a long time coming it hit me pretty hard.  You
 know the deal low self-esteem, am I beautiful, the usual bullshit that comes
 with a break up.  Jim was the stud who was called upon to make things better.
 He was brought here for one reason, to fuck me back to a state of high
 self-esteem. So far he has lived up to his reputation as a "famous lover"
 hell, he even wrote a book about ancient lovemaking.  How could he NOT be a
 good fuck?

 Tonight would be our first night together.  Finally we could take our time, he
 promised hours of fucking and my anticipation was so high that my pantys were
 soaking wet.  I love sex and love a good hard cock in my pussy or mouth, Jim
 was just the right prescription for my desires. Oddly enough I didn't cum
 first time he fucked me, maybe it was nerves or maybe pressure to perform.  He
 was so understanding.  The second time was mind blowing, everything I expected
 from a good fuck.  He ate my pussy, I sucked his dick, nothing fancy just an
 hours worth of pussy pounding. In the end I came on all fours.

 I lied to him, mom wasn't watching the kids, when I left they were sleeping.
 Don't worry I'm a good mom, my 16 yearold daughter was more than capable of
 handling things and my parents live just two floors up.  I felt dirty sneaking
 away but I guess that's part of the turn on.  Look, I need a hard cock and one
 as good as his is hard to pass up.

 "Sit on the edge of the bed" he said.  I sat down and he walked over unzipping
 his jeans.  Wait, no foreplay I thought.  He pulled out his semi-erect cock
 and grabbed the back of my head.  Sure I knew what he wanted I'd had hard
 cocks in my mouth since I was a teenager. I've never seen a cockhead as purple
 as his and hard as glass.  I never noticed how big it was, it was at least
 eight inches long and thick as a coke can and uncircumcised.  I started
 licking the head but he wanted more and right away.  He grabbed the back of my
 head and thrust his cock as far into my mouth as he could.
