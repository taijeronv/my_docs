  How does it feel to be this person, or these people, having sex? How do these
  sex acts feel physically -- soft, tight, sharp, gentle, smooth, cold? 
  How do they feel emotionally â€“ nervous, urgent, giddy, relieved, beloved, dirty?

  It has to convey what the sex means.  Why the people are having it. Whether
  it's giving them what they'd hoped for. What about it is surprising. Whether
  anything is going to be different now because of this sex.

* Mystery's to Solve
** CASE: 140815-1 MP
*** Summary
V claims to have met Matt at the airport and helped with his luggage.

*** Testimony
- V said they met only one time yet she has an email where she explains that
  she is dropping Artem off at the airport then heading back to her hotel.
  She gives him her number and says maybe they can hangout.
- A Google search reveals that Matt lives in Chicago and is a soccer coach.
- V claims they met the baggage claim in London and that her and Anna helped
  him with his luggage.  That was the only contact she ever had with him.
- The old man accused V of having an affair with him.  

*** RFIs
- If she only met him once then why does she have an email saying she will meet
  him or hangout?
- Why does the old-man think she had an affair with him?
- How does the old-man even know about him?
- When did V experience her 12, before or after her divorce?
- Is Matt Agent 12? V claims to have experienced 12 just one time.

*** Conclusions and Speculations
- She had to have met him more than once, especially if there's an email.  
- It's almost as if she met him on one trip, then on a subsequent trip she emails him
  and says she will be in town let's hang out.  Strange.
- I suspect the old-man found out while snooping her emails.
- Or maybe she told him during an argument.

** CASE: 140815-2 Tims69
*** Summary
I discover some emails between V and Tims69.  They were corresponding around
Easter 2014 four months AFTER we started seeing each other.

*** Testimony
- Nothing sexual it seems they were getting to know each other.
- Nothing to indicate they've ever met physically.
- V claims she met him in California and the emails were innocent.
- V they exchanged between 10-12 emails, around Easter time in 2014.
- V sent him pics of some of our outings together.

*** RFIs
- Why did V feel the need to correspond with this person?
- Where did she really meet him?

*** Conclusions and Speculation
- I think V was trying to play both sides just in case one side, mainly me,
  didn't work out.
- I suspect they mat on RoseBrides.com.
- Google search does not show anything meaningful.

** CASE 140815-3 Yellow Gloves
*** Testimony
- V claims she went to this persons apartment for a book on Italy.
- V gets nervous when he starts talking about more personal feelings, she puts
  on some yellow gloves and starts to wash the dishes.
- Why would she go to a single-mans apartment alone?

** CASE: 190521-2 The Couch
*** Testimony
- Why fuck on the couch and not the bed?
- V claims he wasn't special enough yet she was traveling with him and fucking
  his brains out.  How much more special do you need to be?
- She claims that he wasn't special because at this point he violated her
  trust yet he was still special enough to fuck and travel with.
- It doesn't make sense.

** CASE: 190521-1 The Newsletter
*** TODO confirm the timeline of the newsletter visit and actual visit.

*** Summary
V sent me a newsletter that seems to indicate the old-man visited Odessa BEFORE
the actual setup.  The year is 2010.

*** Testimony
- The old-man mentions a woman that picked him up from the airport and delivered
  him to his accommodations.
- He also says that she came back at around 19:00 and stayed to the early
  morning just talking.  she admits that she read his book and says "I'm
  convinced you are the best."
- The following morning she tells her friend (Angela) all about it.
- The old-man was there to see Konstantin, who by the way, was mentioned in
  another email.  The context of which was "free love" or "anything goes."

*** RFIs
- Is the timeline correct? V doesn't deny the story but she does deny the
  timeline.
- If she did meet him before the setup did the fuck?
- If they did was Lori and Yuri aware of it?
- Was V and the old-man playing along during the setup visit? In other words
  they were already fucking, but made it seem like the setup was their first
  meeting.
- Of course this doesn't make sense especially if Lori asked V to pick him up
  during the newsletter visit.

*** Conclusions and Speculation
- I am convinced the woman in the story is V.  
- There's no way Lori and Yuri would not say something to V about his visit.
- I wouldn't be surprised if they were the one's who arranged for her to pick
  him up at the airport.  After all she speaks very good English.
- If the timeline is correct this means that V met the old-man well before the
  setup.
- By my count the old-man has visited Odessa at least three times.  Once for the
  setup, once with his friends, and once for the newsletter.

- Story V sucks dick on the side of the highway on the way to Vegas.

  Unburdened by her previous life she pusues erotic adventures all over the
  world. 
  Rick - Met V on a trip to her country and has fallen in love.  What he really
  loves is the way V takes care of him in the bedroom.
  
- Plot
  - V and her lover have a conversation about sex. V and her lover are still in
    the honeymoon phase which means lots of fucking. V's lover asks where V has
    sucked dick in the past. V tells him in all sorts of places theater, parking
    lot, beach, car. V starts to rub her lovers cock, he has a hard time
    concentrating on driving. V's pussy is throbbing, she is thinking of sucking
    his cock while he drives. They are on the highway going to Vegas about 10
    miles outside of Barstow in the middle of nowhere.
  
  - V's proposes a roadside blowjob. V has a flashback to the year before
    sucking dick in a car. She tells her lover the story but doesn't say who it

    thinks about how much better a fuck her former lover is. She asks him to
    pull over and begins to suck his dick.
  
  - V's sucks her lovers cock. She loves a hard cock in her mouth. She's been
    sucking dick since she was 16. She's never had a bad experience sucking
    dick. She loves how it makes her lover feel. She does it out of love.
 
We were two hours into a four our drive about 10 miles outside of Barstow on our
way to Vegas.  God, it was hot even though the AC in the truck was going full
blast.

Rick is my fiance.  53 years old, somewhat balding, with a paunch for a belly he
wasn't exactly the stud I imagined but he was a good man and slightly above
average in bed.  We were introduced a year ago by my former lover, Jim.  Jim was
20 years older than me and a world renown lover.  That's right I said "world renown."
Apparently Jim wrote a book on Ancient Lovemaking Techniques and is also a
lifelong student and teacher of Kung Fu.  I met Jim right around the time I got
divorced but apparently it was not a chance meeting.  It was actually a setup by
my very good friends, an attempt to boost my confidence and self-esteem.  To put
it bluntly Jim was called upon to fuck me back to being beautiful and he did not
disappoint.  He was passionate lover with a sizeable cock who could last as long
as I needed him too.  I'm sorry I shouldn't be talking about Jim, but sometimes
I can't help it.  He was truly a good fuck but I will save those stories for
later.

Rick wasn't a bad lover but he was no Jim either.  I thought to myself if I'm
going to marry this guy I really need him to up his game.  I'm not  


Let me just say that I love giving oral pleasure almost more then I love
receiving it.  I guess you could say it's my specialty but you don't have to
take my word for it just ask my previous lovers. 
 
Rick, was a boring sort. Middleaged white American his lovemaking left a bit to
be dsired. Now, don't get my wrong I don't think all white middleaged american's
are boring but in Rick's case he fit that mold. My previous American, older by
20 years, was the best lover I've ever had. Jim was a martial arts master and an
authority on ancient lovemaking techniques. If anyone was expected to be good in
bed it was him. I guess it's unfair to make a comparison. On this trip Rick and
I got engaged which means he now has the title "best lover I've ever had"
even though he was somewhere in the middle. I can tell you that more often than
not I have to think of the old-man in order to cum.

Needless to say our conversation about sex got my juices flowing.  I could feel
the throbbing below and the wetness that spread.  The thought occurred to me
that if Rick doesn't fuck me the way I like then I should teach him.  I rememver
a time when many of my lovers had to teach me a trick or two.  

"Baby, why don't you pull over I'd like to take some pics of the countryside" I
said.

"Ok, my love"

I could tell Rick was confused, we were 10 miles outside of Barstow on our way
to Vegas.  In other words we were in the middle of nowhere.
  
I reached over and started to rub his hard penis through his jeans.  

"Fuck, that feels good" he said "Don't stop."

"Would you like me to do more than rub it?" I asked.

Before he could answer I started to unzip his pants.  I could see the outline of
his hardness and a wet spot of precum on his underwear and squeezed the shaft.
I squeezed it alternating the rhythm, until his precum soaked through.

I pulled his cock out and traced the tip with my fingers.  It gave hard twitch
is if it were lunging to bite my finger off.  The head was a dark red and veins
were swollen with blood.

I gripped his swollen penis with one hand and bent down to lick up a big drop of
precum that had oozed out of the head.  I sealed my lips around the head and
slowly took his whole cock into my mouth.  He wasn't as big as the old-man I had
no problem swallowing him to his balls.  I held him in my mouth and my tongue
bathed it in spit.  I'm telling you ladies, men love it when you're sloppy and wet.
